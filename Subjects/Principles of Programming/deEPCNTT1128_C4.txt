[5550000000]<br>
[555       ] (7 spaces)<br>
d<br>
Here, in the printf() function, there is a left-justification specifier ("-"). If '0' is added, it can only be added to the right of 555, but doing so would change the value of 555 to 5550000000. Therefore, the "0" specifier in this function only adds spaces to the output field, not zeros to that field.<br>
